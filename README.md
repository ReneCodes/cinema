AS part of my tertiary education our task was to Design and build a website that confirms to current web standards in HTML and CSS, using appropriate techniques, taking usability and accessibility into account.

In addition I tested and reflected on the usability of a website focussing on its ability to communicate its content clearly to analyse UX and UCD web design concepts.
